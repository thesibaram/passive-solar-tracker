# ðŸŒž passive-solar-tracker
This project demonstrates a Passive Solar Tracking System that automatically adjusts the orientation of solar panels throughout the day using Nitinol Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires. Designed for sustainability, it requires no external power source. Includes CAD models, simulations, and a prototype design for efficient solar energy capture.
